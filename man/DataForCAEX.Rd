\title{Data for function CAEX}
\format{
\code{CAEX_CAs} is a list of stored CAs for the character string entries of
\code{CAEX_lineages}, with names corresponding to those character string entries.

\code{CAEX_lineages} is a list of lists of lists of lists, where the first and second list
each have length one only and are named \code{2} for the strength and \code{3}
for the number of levels of all arrays, whereas the list \code{CAEX_lineages[['2']][['3']]}
has length 40 and names \code{11} to \code{50}, for the run sizes of the respective CAs.

An object of class \code{list} of length 24.

\code{\link{TJcat}}.\cr
The creation of the objects is documented by R files in the \code{extdata}
folder of this package, which can be located using
\code{system.file("extdata", package="CAs")}, the actual raw arrays
for \code{CAEX_CAs} be found there as well.

\section{Details}{

This section provides background information for interested users.
Array creation can be easily accomplished via the function \code{\link{CAEX}},
which works for strength 2 with 3-level columns.

Torres-Jimenez et al. (2021) used product constructions and column extensions
to create a series of strength 2 CAs with 3-level columns from 11 to 50 runs.
Later CAs build on the best earlier CAs. The column extensions were obtained
with massive computer search effort. Hence, arrays obtained from those are stored
in the list \code{CAEX_CAs}, and their names are given in the object \code{CAEX_lineages}.
Arrays for larger numbers of runs (34, and 36 to 50) can be obtained from function
\code{\link{productCA}}, and the details are given in the respective entry of
\code{CAEX_lineage}.
