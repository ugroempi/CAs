\title{Useful arrays for covering array constructions}
\format{
All arrays from this package that are listed here
have their rows arranged such that constant rows are
at the top or in PCA format; if there are fewer than \code{v} constant rows, they are
usually arranged in PCA format (see \code{\link{productPCA}}).\cr
\code{miscCAcat} also contains references to orthogonal arrays from R package \pkg{\link{DoE.base}},
e.g. \code{DoE.base::L81.3.5-1}, which is an OA(81,4,5,3)
(strength 4; 1 is subtracted, because OAs in that package
are coded with levels starting at 1,
whereas CAs in this package have levels starting at 0).\cr
\code{ca26.4.15}, \code{ca23.4.8}, \code{ca30.5.7} and \code{ca41.6.6} are strength 2 CAs.\cr
There is also the list \code{CohenSA} that contains strength 2 CAs that were created by Cohen using
simulated annealing.

\code{oa1728.12.6}, \code{3375.15.6} and \code{oa9261.21.6} are strength 3
orthogonal arrays (classes \code{ca} and \code{oa})
and matrices with levels starting at 0.
They might eventually reside in the R package \pkg{\link{DoE.base}}.

\code{miscCAcat} is a data.frame that collects the properties of all the
CAs (including orthogonal arrays and the CAs from within \code{CohenSA})
that are documented in this file.
It has the columns \code{t}, \code{k}, \code{v},
\code{N}, \code{fns} (character), \code{nconst}, \code{PCAstatus} (numeric,
holds \code{k1}; \code{v} implies that \code{nconst=v}, i.e., k1=k)
and \code{hasNA} (logical, at present, FALSE for all entries).

\source{
\code{oa12.2.8} was created by the package author based on learning about
its existence (with two constant rows) from Colbourn and Torres-Jimenez (2010)
and Cohen, Colbourn and Ling (2003).\cr
The list \code{CohenSA} holds arrays created by Cohen via simulated annealing (personal communication).\cr
\code{oa1728.12.6} was created by the package author using construction 2
of Ji and Yin (2010).\cr
The creation of the objects is documented by the R file \code{miscCAs.R}
in the \code{extdata} folder of this package, which can be located using
\code{system.file("extdata", package="CAs")}.
