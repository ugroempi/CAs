\title{Data for function tjCA}
\format{
\code{TJcat} is a data.frame with columns \code{t} (strength), \code{k} (number of CA columns),
\code{v} (number of levels), \code{N} (number of CA rows), \code{filesize} (the file size in bytes),
\code{nameInTJ2level_CAs}, \code{replaceable} and \code{code}.
Row names hold the names of the downloaded files.\cr
CAs corresponding to rows
with entries in \code{code} are created by executing the code of
column \code{code} (either with function \code{\link{CAEX}} for 3-level
or with one of several constructions for 2-level),\cr
CAs corresponding to rows with entries in \code{nameInTJ2level_CAs} by
picking the respective entry from \code{TJ2levelCAs}.\cr
CAs corresponding to rows with neither entry cannot be created at present
(many might be constructable by the power construction which will be
implemented shortly and will then be incorporated in the \code{code} column).

\code{TJ2level_CAs} is a list of arrays (class \code{ca}) corresponding to the
rows of \code{TJcat} with entries in \code{nameInTJ2level_CAs} (access via names).

An object of class \code{list} of length 141.

\source{
The source is the no longer functional website \code{https://www.tamps.cinvestav.mx/~oc/} by
Torres-Jimenez (without year). Web archive versions of that site are useless, because they
do not include the arrays.\cr
The creation of the objects is documented by R files in the \code{extdata}
folder of this package, which can be located using
\code{system.file("extdata", package="CAs")}, the actual raw arrays
can be found there as well (omitting large ones that can be constructed
at least approximately by a recursive construction).

TJ2level_CAs
}
\description{
The data.frame TJcat supports the identification of CAs from the
list TJ2level_CAs
}
\section{Details}{

The data.frame \code{TJcat} holds information on 2-level CAs of strength 3
from Torres-Jimenez (2021),
covered by function \code{\link{CAEX}} of this package,\cr
and on 2-level CAs of strengths 3 to 6.
The list \code{TJ2level_CAs} holds actual arrays for the latter case.
These have been selected by size, i.e., too large ones have been omitted.
The unavailable 2-level arrays
(empty string in column \code{TJ2level_CAs}) can \emph{in principle} be constructed
by the construction of Colbourn and Torres-Jimenez (2010).
In various cases, post-processing steps by Torres-Jimenez, not implemented in the package,
reduced the run size of the pure construction or added a column to the pure construction.
Furthermore, as not all ingredients are available in this package (yet),
some sizes can not be achieved by the package. The size of the arrays
has nevertheless precluded the inclusion of the larger arrays into the package, in the interest
interest of limiting package size.

## an impression of the content
head(TJcat)
fivenum(TJcat$N)

## the following is not run because of run times
## in CRAN checks
\dontrun{

fivenum(ratio)
## 0.9286 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0446
## the arrays are pretty close to the best-known,
