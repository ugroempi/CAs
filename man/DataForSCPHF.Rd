\title{Data for the SCPHF-based (permutation vector) constructions}
\format{
\code{SMC_SCPHFs}, \code{CL_SCPHFs} and \code{WC_SCPHFs}
are lists of lists:

The first hierarchy level is the strength \code{t}:\cr
All lists hold at least elements for strengths 3 and 4, \code{WC_SCPHFs} also a few elements for strengths 5 and 6.\cr
Each of these holds lists for the implemented numbers of levels \code{v},
which in turn hold entries for the implemented numbers of columns \code{k}.

\code{SCPHFcat} is a data frame with columns \code{t}, \code{v}, \code{k}, \code{N}
and \code{type}. The latter indicates the source: for "2006", the source is
the Sherwood et al. (2006) paper and SCPHFs are in \code{SMC_SCPHFs},\cr
for "2009" the source is Walker and Colbourn (2009) with arrays from Walker's
GitHub repository and arrays are in \code{WC_SCPHFs},\cr
for "2018" the source is work by Erin Lanus and co-authors,
and SCPHFs are in \code{CL_SCPHFs} (arrays found in the Dwyer (2024) GitHub repository).

An object of class \code{data.frame} with 79 rows and 5 columns.

An object of class \code{list} of length 2.

An object of class \code{list} of length 4.

For more details, see also the documentation of function
\code{\link{scphfCA}}.\cr
The creation of the objects is documented in the R files \code{SherwoodMartirosyanColbournCPHF.R},
\code{Lanus_SCPHFs_from_DwyerRepo.R} and \code{SCPHF_dimchecks.R} in the \code{extdata}
folder of this package, which can be located using
\code{system.file("extdata", package="CAs")}; the implemented raw SCPHFs from the DWYER
repo are in the sub folder \code{SCPHFs} of that folder.
