\title{Function to obtain the best uniform CA for a combination of t, k and v}
\usage{
bestCA(t, k, v, maxN=1000000, fixNA=TRUE, seed=NULL, ...)

bestN(t, k, v, internet=TRUE, exclude=NULL, ...)

ckrsCA(t, k, v, ...)

dwyerCA(t, k, v, ...)

nistCA(t, k, v, ...)

tjCA(t, k, v, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{integer: the strength}

\item{k}{integer: the number of columns}

\item{v}{integer: the number of levels for each column}

\item{maxN}{integer: the largest number of runs N for
which an array is desired; if the smallest possible N is larger,
an error is thrown; default: 1000000
(too large for being created in reaonable time on most computers)}

\item{fixNA}{logical: should flexible values be fixed?\cr
If the ingoing CA has flexible values, \code{fixNA=TRUE}
randomly assigns a fixed value to each flexible value.\cr
Thus, a seed is needed for reproducibility.}

\item{seed}{\code{NULL} or an integer seed for making the
fixing of NA values reproducible; if \code{seed=NULL},
a seed is randomly obtained and stored in the attribute
\code{fixNA_seed} of the returned object.}

\item{...}{handed to construction function, currently,
only implemented for \code{fuseBose}, for enabling \code{fixNA=FALSE}}

\item{internet}{logical; if FALSE, methods whose designs need an internet
connection are excluded}

\item{exclude}{\code{NULL} or a character vector of method(s) to exclude,
in support of size calculations for recursive constructions
which need to calculate sizes of best ingredients}
}
\value{
\code{bestN} returns a named integer: the first method that yields the
smallest implemented size.\cr
The other functions return a matrix of class \code{ca},
which is a uniform covering array of strength at least \code{t} with
\code{k} columns at \code{v} levels.
}
\description{
The function uses function Ns to find the best currently implemented
CA for the requested scenario.
}
\section{Details}{

Function \code{bestCA} uses function \code{\link{Ns}} for locating
the best construction for the given scenario, and subsequently
implements the first such construction, where the order is that
returned by function \code{\link{Ns}}.

Some constructions (\code{"DWYER"} and \code{"NIST"}) require an internet
connection, because the respective CAs are not part of the package.

Some constructions provide CAs with flexible values, which are denoted
as NA values in package \pkg{CAs}. These need to be fixed for actual
experimentation, and function \code{bestCA} fixes them randomly; in such
cases, the returned object has an attribute \code{fixNA_seed}, which is
either the seed that was specified by the user or a seed that was created
by the function. Specifying the seed in a subsequent call to the function
permits to get the same CA again (provided that no new smaller CAs have
been implemented).

The attributes of the returned object contain elements \code{eCAN},
\code{CAs-version} and \code{date}: \code{eCAN} gives the current
best array; as this may change, the other attributes provide the
context.
