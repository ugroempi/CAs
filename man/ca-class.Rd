\section{Details}{

The print method for class \code{ca} suppresses printing of most attributes,
but indicates which attributes are available.

The S3 class \code{ca} is for a matrix with attributes.
Common attributes are \code{origin}, \code{t}, \code{Call},
\code{eCAN}, \code{date}, \code{CAs-version}, \code{flexible} or \code{PCAstatus}.
Not all attributes are present for all \code{ca} objects.

The matrix elements are consecutive non-negative integers starting with 0 or 1,
and possibly missing values that stand for flexible values, i.e.,
values that can be arbitrarily chosen without deteriorating the strength of the CA.
